🔐 SecureShare - A Secure File Sharing System
----------------------------------------------

This is a web-based project built using Spring Boot that allows users to upload, share, and manage files securely. The system includes features like encryption, auto-deletion, trash management, email alerts, and history tracking.

📄 About the Project:
-----------------------

This project is designed to mimic the behavior of file-sharing tools like Google Drive, but with automatic clean-up and added security. It is a single-user prototype for secure document sharing.

🚀 Features :
--------------

1. 📤 File Upload
   - User can upload any type of file from local device.

2. 🔒 AES Encryption
   - Uploaded files are encrypted before storing to ensure data security.
   - Even if someone accesses the storage, the file is unreadable without a key.

3. 🔗 Download Link Generation
   - A unique URL is created for every uploaded file so others can download it.

4. 🗑️ Auto Trash System
   - Files older than a specific time are automatically moved to trash.
   - This is handled by a scheduled task running in the background.

5. ♻️ Restore from Trash
   - Deleted or auto-trashed files can be recovered manually.

6. 📧 Email Notification
   - A mail is sent whenever a file is uploaded or auto-deleted.
   - Works through SMTP setup in the application properties.

7. 🕓 History Tracking
   - The system keeps records of all files, including deleted ones.
   - The history section allows users to view previous uploads.

8. 🖥️ Frontend UI
   - Simple and responsive HTML + CSS based user interface.
   - JavaScript is used for interactive operations like file selection and modal popups.
